# Vote India Secure: Project Report & Documentation

## 1. Project Overview: Why this Project?
**Project Name:** Vote India Secure

**The Problem:**
Traditional corporate voting (AGMs - Annual General Meetings) is often:
-   **Slow:** Paper ballots or physical presence required.
-   **Expensive:** Mailing documents, booking venues.
-   **Insecure:** Hard to verify who actually voted.

**Our Solution (The "Why"):**
We built "Vote India Secure" to create a **digital, immutable (unchangeable), and accessible** voting platform. The goal is to allow shareholders to vote from anywhere in the world while ensuring that *every single vote* is verified and distinct.

## 2. Tools & Technologies (A-Z)
Here is the list of tools we used and the specific reason **why** we chose them for this project.

| Tool | Category | Why we used it? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lucide React** | Icons | Provides clean, professional icons (like the Shield, Lock, Eye) to make the UI intuitive. |
| **React** | Frontend | It allows us to build a "Single Page Application" (SPA). This means the page never reloads (like a mobile app), giving a smooth, premium feel. |
| **Resend** | Email Service | **Critical Component.** We use this to send the *User ID* and *Password* to shareholders. We chose it because it's reliable and developer-friendly. |
| **SHA-256** | Security | The technology used to "hash" (scramble) passwords. Even if a hacker sees the database, they only see scrambled letters, not the real password. |
| **Supabase** | Backend/DB | It provides a securely hosted **PostgreSQL** database. It handles the "heavy lifting" of storing votes and users so we didn't have to build a server from scratch. |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Styling | Used to create the "Premium" aesthetic (Gradients, Glass-morphism, Animations) without writing thousands of lines of custom CSS. |
| **TypeScript** | Language | It strictly checks our code for errors *before* we run it. (e.g., It prevents us from doing math on text). |
| **Zod** | Validation | It acts as a "Gatekeeper". It checks if an email is actually an email, or if a password is long enough, *before* sending data to the server. |

## 3. Data Storage & Security
**"Is it Safe? Is it Hackable?"**

No system is 100% unhackable, but we have used **Enterprise-Grade Security** standards to make it extremely difficult to breach.

### A. How Data is Stored (The Database)
We use **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** in the cloud.
-   **Row Level Security (RLS):** This is a special security rule we turned on. It means:
    -   A *Company Admin* can ONLY see their own company's data.
    -   A *Shareholder* can ONLY see their own vote.
    -   Even if you are logged in, you cannot "peek" at another company's data.

### B. Password Safety
We do **NOT** store passwords in plain text (e.g., "password123").
-   **For Companies:** We use Supabase Auth (industry standard).
-   **For Shareholders:** We use **SHA-256 Encryption**.
    -   When a shareholder enters their password, we convert it to a "Hash" (e.g., `a5f3c...`) in their browser.
    -   We compare this hash with the one in the database.
    -   **Result:** The server never even *sees* the real password, only the hash.

## 4. The Authentication Flow (User ID & Email)

**Q: Why do we send User ID and Password via Email? Why not just "Sign Up"?**

**The Reason:**
In a corporate voting scenario, shareholders *already* exist. They shouldn't just "sign up" freely (otherwise, anyone could fake being a shareholder!).
1.  **The Company** uploads the shareholder list.
2.  **The System** creates a unique, randomly generated **User ID** and **Password** for that specific shareholder.
3.  **The Delivery:** We use the **Email** (via Resend) as the secure "Courier" to deliver these credentials to the verified shareholder's inbox.
4.  **The Vote:** The shareholder uses these exact credentials to "unlock" their ballot. Once they vote, that User ID is locked from voting again.

**Concept:** Think of it like a **Bank PIN** sent to your mail, rather than you choosing your own generic password. It is much more secure for this specific purpose.

## 5. Important Project Note (For Demo)
*(Note to Reviewer/Teacher)*
Since this is a student project running on the **Free Tier** of the email service (Resend):
-   Emails might usually be restricted to a single "Verified" email address (e.g., the developer's email) to prevent spam.
-   In the code ([email.ts](file:///d:/vote-india-secure-main/src/lib/email.ts)), you might see a variable `VERIFIED_EMAIL`. This is normal for development. In a real "Production" app, we would buy a domain and send to everyone.
